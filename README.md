# My first github project
Made a program that uses the Python os library to create a folder on the user's desktop and populate it with 5 .txt and 2 .doc files and displays them in a window after a button is pushed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python(3.10.5)

Initially the program creates a folder with the aforementioned files. The program then reads each path of the file's paths into corresponding variables. The GUI was made with the Python tkinter library, upon starting the program a window with a prompt asking the user whether they would like to see the files that were added to their desktop is given. A button with, "Yes!" is pushable and upon pushing will display the path of each file populated within the folder created in the very same window.

## Optimizations

I could have dabbled a little more with the look of the GUI. I also could have sliced the paths out of each string being displayed from the two corresponding .txt and .doc lists.

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to use the os and tkinter libraries through this little ol project was very fun for me. I learned more than I have in most of my classes by just doing. Pursuing a goal in mind for a project (whether it is small or large) and actually completing it felt great and taught me a whole lot in the process. I also learned that majority of the time spent was learning how to actually achive what I wanted to, the actual implementation of the code took not much time at all.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
